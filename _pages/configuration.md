# Configuration

Settings that affect the site as a whole can be found in the `_config.yml` file located in the root of your project. If you do not have one of these files, you can create a blank file or copy the [default _config.yml](https://github.com/SevenZeroThree/zero/blob/master/_config.yml) file from the theme.

The theme's default _config.yml file contains comments for each of the configuration options with the intent that it provides some context for what each of them do. More detailed explanations for all of the configuration options can be found below.

## Title
This is the name of your site. It will appear in several areas of the theme:

- Most importantly, it will appear in the `<title>` HTML tag
- The top left of every page in the header area
- The bottom left of every page in the footer area

*Example Usage*:  `title: "My Site"`
